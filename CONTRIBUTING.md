# Community Shaders Contribution Guidelines
If you would like to contribute to Community Shaders, you can do so by raising a pull request (PR) or raising an issue with an attached patch.

## What is considered a useful contribution

- New Community Shader features
- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- Documentation
- Code refactors

New features should offer functionality to end-users. Backend systems for other features are not considered features.

All contributions fall under this project's license, GPL-3.0 or later.

## AI Usage

- AI-assisted work is accepted by this project, but vibecoding is not.
- You must understand your own contribution. If a maintainer asks what your code does or why, you need to be able to explain and defend it. If you can't, it isn't ready to PR.

## PR Guidelines
- All PRs *must* follow CS coding style and software development best practices.
- PRs should have atomic commits. A PR with one large commit may have to be resubmitted as a PR with atomic commits before it is reviewed.
- PRs will only be merged if all comments are resolved.
  - The exception to this rule is Coderabbit comments, which can be dismissed if not applicable. However, you may need to explain why you dismissed a Coderabbit comment, so ensure you have good reason to do so.
- Avoid rebasing your branch as this loses commit history and makes it harder to review the diff.
- PR titles need to follow conventional commit rules and be short.
- PRs should only have useful code comments, such as explaining something that's not obvious. A PR filled with AI-slop comments will not be merged.
- Do not PR work-in-progress code. This means no debugging code, commented-out experiments, draft code, etc. We do not allow this even if you intend to clean up with a follow-up PR. All PRs must be polished when raised, even if the feature itself is incomplete.
- There should be no dead code in your PR. If it will be used in a subsequent PR, raise the code in there, not ahead of time.
- Feature settings should be included in PR if applicable. Don't PR a feature that needs settings without them.
- Don't add an unreasonable number of settings for your feature. Only what is needed.
- Ideally, you'll PR with some performance numbers (CPU and GPU) in hand. This is not required to raise a PR, but without concrete numbers, it will be harder/impossible to get your work merged.
- Where possible, add profile markers.
- Work that is incomplete and actively worked on can use one of the following flags:
  - **Alpha** - high level system or a working portion of a feature.
  - **Beta** - feature complete, but in need of testing and/or bug fixes.
  - **Unreleased** - feature complete, but temporarily unable to be released.
- Large features (+4,000 lines of code) should be broken up into smaller, digestible pieces. If you raise a large PR, it may not be reviewed at all.
  - If breaking up your large feature into smaller PRs, please ensure each PR:
    - Is polished.
    - Has performance numbers.
    - Sets/updates the feature flag accordingly, if applicable.
