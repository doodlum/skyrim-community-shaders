.SYNOPSIS
    Build DXVK's d3d11 + dxgi (the dxvk_d3d11/dxvk_dxgi renderer DLLs Community Shaders stages)
    from the extern/dxvk submodule — fast and incrementally — so every Build*.bat produces them
    with no separate meson step.

.DESCRIPTION
    Called by BuildRelease.bat (and therefore by every one-click wrapper) before the CMake
    configure/build. The configure-time staging guard in CMakeLists.txt
    (if EXISTS extern/dxvk/build/src/d3d11/d3d11.dll) then picks the DLLs up and stages them.

    Speed:
      * Only d3d11 + dxgi are built. CS loads nothing else, and the full DXVK build additionally
        needs the legacy d3d8.h which is absent from the modern Windows SDK (so a full build fails
        locally anyway).
      * Incremental: if the DLLs already exist and were built from the current submodule commit
        (recorded in a stamp file), this is a no-op — warm builds pay nothing for DXVK.
      * meson's --vsenv activates the Visual Studio toolchain itself (via vswhere), so this works
        from a plain shell without a vcvars prompt.

    Exit code: 0 on build / skip / "meson missing but DLLs already present" (non-fatal — the build
    proceeds and CMake's guard just reuses or skips). Non-zero only on a genuine meson build failure.

.PARAMETER BuildType
    meson --buildtype (default 'release'). DXVK is a runtime DLL; a release DXVK is fine even for
    a Debug-config CS build, and keeps it fast.

# NOTE on unity (jumbo) builds: '-Dunity=on' does NOT work with this DXVK, in TWO independent ways,
# so it is intentionally not used (measured + verified 2026-07):
#   1. The vendored 'libdisplay-info' C subproject has file-local helpers (add_failure,
#      parse_data_block, destroy_data_block) that collide when merged into one TU (C2084/C2371).
#      This one IS scope-avoidable: meson >= ~1.10 honors '-Dlibdisplay-info:unity=off' (meson 1.7,
#      the current MSI build, silently ignores it and still emits display-info-unity0.c.obj).
#   2. Even with libdisplay-info excluded, the DXVK CORE (src/dxvk) unity TU fails: the dxbc-spirv
#      sub-subproject header spirv_types.h has no include guard / #pragma once, so two .cpp files in
#      the merged TU re-include it -> C2011 struct redefinitions across SpirvHeader/SpirvBuilder/etc.
#      Fixing this needs include-guard edits inside the dxbc-spirv submodule headers (or excluding
#      src/dxvk from unity, which discards most of the benefit) -- neither is a committable
#      build-tooling change, and excluding the core would leave little to unify.
# Net: a robust committable unity is not achievable here without upstream/fork header fixes. The
# compile is already parallel (ninja, all cores) and the target set is pruned to d3d11+dxgi
# (-Denable_d3d8/9/10=false); that is DXVK's cold-build floor.
